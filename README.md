Project Mjolnir is an open-source project which aims to build an open-source adaptable mountain bike for wheelchair users. 
The primary objective of which is to introduce a modular platform that is upgradeable over time for the user as well as being cost effective to do so.
So far there has been 30,000+ USD spent on the design and development of the bike. This has all been personal investment from Noel Joyce. 
This has allowed for the development of a highly realized prototype which will undergo testing at the end of December and early January. 
Many technical issues have been addressed but it is anticipated there will be more after testing.
Due to the modularity of the system it will need research and design work carried out to create the different components.

I chose Project Mjolnir as a zero credit course/Vertically Integrated Project (VIP) in Fall '23. This repo contains the updates to the backrest and the footrest of the bike. 
The bike frame is uploaded as an image.
